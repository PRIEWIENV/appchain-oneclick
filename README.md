# Nervos AppChain OneClick

Nervos AppChain OneClick is based on Nervos AppChain tool chain. It combines almost all the Nervos AppChain development necessities,  including [CITA](https://github.com/cryptape/cita), [Microscope](https://github.com/cryptape/microscope) and [ReBirth](https://github.com/cryptape/re-birth), into one package. Developers who want to quickly start Nervos AppChain to have an overview or want to perform an agile prototype development only need to enter a few command lines.

## Disclaimer

appchain-oneclick is just a developing tool now, do not take it as an official chain.
